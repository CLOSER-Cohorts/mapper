    raise your finger. Keep it raised as long as you can hear the sound, no matter

    It is important that you keep as quiet as possible, in order to hear the quietest
    tones. Even if the sound is very faint, and no matter which ear it is in, raise
    your finger. It will help if you breathe quietly through your mouth. No matter
